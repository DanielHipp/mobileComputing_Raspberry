\section{Introduction}
The goal of this project is to provide a screen to show notifications and text from a smartphone so that they are better visible. The next step is to provide image thumbnails on the screeen.

An inexpensive replacement for a screen is a dot matrix, that can be easily connected to an Arduino or Raspberry Pi. Due to the networking requirement of the task the Raspberry Pi version 3 seems to be the better choice over an Arduino. The latest Raspberry Pi has multiple network interfaces, such as LAN, WiFi and Bluetooth.


\section{State of the Art}



\section{Proposed approach}
The application needs a server and a client, to receive text and image or to send them, respectively.

Because text can be easily sent over the HTTP protocol, and 16x16 (=256) digits (0 or 1) for the iamges can be easily converted to text, we chose HTTP for transmission between the Raspberry Pi and smartphone.


\subsection{Coose the matrix}
The matrix must be compatible with the Rasbperry Pi, but for testing the matrix itself the compatibility to Arduino is desirable. So the protocol must be either SPI or I2C, because both are supported on Raspberry Pi and Arduino.

It also must not consume more energy than the Raspbery Pi and Arduiono can provide. So it must work at a volate of 3.3V or 5V and must draw at most 50mA and 300mA repectively\cite{b0};


\subsection{Communication}
For communication between Raspberry Pi and smartphone we have two possibilities: either Bluetooth or over a local network. Since the user may already have the smartphone connected to a headphone or headset, we chose to use the smartphone's Wifi interface.

The Raspberry Pi has a LAN and WiFi interface, so we chose to create a new WiFi access point with the Raspberry Pi. This way we can make sure that the Raspberry Pi always has the same IP address, which makes connecting easier. To ensure the normal usage of the smartphone, after it connected to the Raspberry Pi, it must be connected to the existing router by a LAN cable prior to installation. This makes it also easier to set up the Raspberry Pi, because no WiFi passphrase of the original WiFi must be entered. Figure~\ref{FIG:COMMUNICATION} shows an overview of the communication.

\subsection{WiFi access point}
To function as an access point, the Raspberry Pi needs packages for the access point itself, a DHCP server and for network address translation (NAT). Therefore two daemons are needed, one for using the Wifi interface a an host for the access point (hostapd) and one DHCP daemon.

The host access point daemon is configured to use wlan0 as the network interface (the Raspberry Pi's default one) and WPA2  encryption with a predefined password.

The DHCP server must assign an address to the smartphone connecting to the WiFi. It also communicates the Raspberry Pi as the Gateway so that the smartphone can connect to the internet.

Iptables is configured so that the smartphone in the Raspberry Pi's WiFi can access the internet through NAT at the Pi's LAN interface. This is solved that way, that new connections from the WiFi are accepted, but no new connections from the LAN NIC. Packages at the LAN NIC are only accepted, when they belong to an existing connection.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
